Hello! 
I (Ishaan D)) made this Roadrunner Quickstart Repo for team 20240 Slingyshawty!

This is beneficial because it has a SampleAutoConcept.java file which basically is an ITD autonomous program
I have created code for all subsystems and set up this repo in such a way, that when cloned can be easily used for any robot

Check out the mechanisms_and_movement folder which includes everything I created :)
This quickstart is made for a 2 deadwheel robot
